    <h1>Frank the Elephant</h1>
    <h2>Master of Looking <em>Soo</em> Good</h2>

    <p>I am Frank the Elephant and I am applying for the position of photographic elephant #4
    because I always look good.  Looking good just comes natural to me and when I saw the position open, I jumped on it.  You
    can see in the picture below how good I look.  If you get confused, please consult my 5 Reasons
    Frank the Elephant always looks good below.
    </p>

    <h3>5 Reasons I Look Good</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>I have a trunk</li>
      <li>I am the color gray</li>
      <li>I am looking at the camera, which is cool</li>
      <li>I have nice toes</li>
      <li>Just look at me</li>
    </ol>
